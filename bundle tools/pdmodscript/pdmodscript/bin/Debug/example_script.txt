@Name Example Mod
@Description This is my example mod. It doesn't actually do anything useful.

; Blank lines are ignored as well.
; All other lines are treated as file replacement lines.
; File lines are in the format of <original file path> <colon> <replacement file path>
; The spaces around the colon are optional, but help readability.

; Removed all the cameras!
settings/cameras.cameras : my_camera_replacement_file.xml
; Replaced all sounds with nothing!
soundbanks/job_esc_park.1.bnk : job_esc_park_replacement.bnk
